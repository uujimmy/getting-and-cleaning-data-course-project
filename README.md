# Project for `Getting and Cleaning Data` Coursera Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The project has one R script called `run_analysis.R` that does the following:

* Step 0. Load activity labels and features.
* Step 1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Step 2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Step 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Step 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Step 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* Step 6. Write tidy dataset into the file - result.txt.
